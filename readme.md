A simple script that adds a blank space into the macOS dock.

Instructions:
From the Terminal, without the quotes, type "python add_dock_space.py" and press <Enter>.

You'll see after a moment that a new transparent icon has been added to the right side of your dock. You can drag the icon where you want it, and you can ctrl+click on it to remove it from the dock. If you want more blank spaces, run the script again.

Note: Sometimes the script will run, but a blank space won't be created. This happens rarely, and the blank space seems to pop up later. I don't know why this happens, but if you run the script again you should be good to go.

I created the script to automate the creation of the blank space, but the bash code to actually create the space was found at: https://www.imore.com/add-space-your-mac-dock
